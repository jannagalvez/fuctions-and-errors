# fuctions-and-errors

# Overview
A basic Solidity smart contract that shows how to use the require(), assert(), and revert() statements can be found in this repository. In the development of smart contracts, these assertions are important for managing special situations, demonstrating internal state, and implementing preconditions.

# Code Explanation
- require(): Used to set requirements that must be fulfilled in order for a function to work properly. It assists in input validation and stops wrong state changes.
- assert(): Verifies that the contract is free of internal mistakes and constant violations. It is important for maintaining the validity of the state of the contract.
- revert(): With an error message specified, reverses a transaction. It's helpful for managing unusual situations and stopping transactions when specific requirements aren't fulfilled.

# Conditions
In order to connect with the smart contract, you must:
- An Ethereum smart contract development environment (such as Remix, Truffle, Hardhat)
- An Ethereum wallet or client (like MetaMask) for testnet or mainnet deployment and communication with the contract
